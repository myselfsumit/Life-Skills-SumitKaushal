### Steps to take

- **Follow established procedures**: Use the workplace reporting mechanisms, and maintain confidentiality throughout the process.[web:9][web:5]
- **No retaliation**: Be aware it is illegal for employers to retaliate against anyone who complains about harassment.[web:10]

### If a witness
- Encourage the affected person to report the incident.
