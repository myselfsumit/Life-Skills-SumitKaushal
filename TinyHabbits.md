# Tiny Habits - Simple Notes

## 1. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg

### What story or idea was the most interesting?
I found it surprising how starting with very tiny actions makes habits easier. BJ Fogg talked about doing something as small as flossing one tooth or only doing two push-ups. These tiny steps feel easy and take away the fear of big changes. The most important point was that *feeling good* after the small success is what really helps build habits—not just motivation.

## 2. Key Message of Tiny Habits

### How does B = MAP make new habits easier? What do M, A, and P mean?
BJ Fogg explains that behavior happens when three things come together:
- **M (Motivation):** Wanting to do the action.
- **A (Ability):** How simple it is to do the action.
- **P (Prompt):** A signal or reminder to do it.

To create good habits, it helps to focus more on making things easy (ability) and setting up reminders (prompts), since motivation alone is not reliable.

### Why is it important to celebrate after doing a habit?
Celebration makes you feel happy, sending a positive signal to your brain. This could be smiling, saying “Yes!” or giving yourself a high five. Over time, this feeling helps lock in the habit, making your brain want to repeat it.

## 3. The 1% Better Every Day Idea

### What idea stood out most?
The power of getting just a little bit better each day can add up to huge changes over time. Small improvements might not seem special at first, but if repeated every day, they create big results. This teaches that doing something regularly matters more than doing a lot at once.

## 4. Atomic Habits Book Summary

### What does the book say about identity and habits?
The book says habits connect strongly to who we think we are. Instead of just trying to reach a goal, it’s better to focus on becoming the kind of person who does that thing. For example, saying “I am a reader” instead of “I want to read more.” When habits fit our self-image, they stick longer.

### How does the book say to make a habit easier?
One idea is the **Two-Minute Rule**: start with the smallest possible step, like reading one page or putting on workout clothes. Also, make the habit easy by removing obstacles and linking it with fun activities. The simpler and more enjoyable the habit, the easier it is to keep doing it.

---

### How does the book say to make a habit harder to do?
Increase the difficulty by taking away triggers and adding steps. For example, removing unhealthy snacks from sight, deleting distracting apps, or making it inconvenient to repeat the habit. The harder it is, the less likely it is to continue.

## 5. Reflection

### Pick a habit to do more. How will you make the cue obvious, the habit attractive or easy, and the response satisfying?
**Habit:** Reading every day for at least 20 minutes.

Steps:
- Keep the book where it’s easy to see.
- Choose books I actually want to read.
- Begin with just 5 minutes a day, slowly increasing time.
- Track my progress and give myself a small reward after finishing chapters.

### Pick a habit to do less. How will you make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, and the response less satisfying?
**Habit:** Spending too much time on social media.

Steps:
- Turn off notifications and keep my phone away during work or study.
- Remind myself how social media eats up my time.
- Remove apps from my home screen or use blockers for time limits.
- Replace scrolling with things like taking a walk or journaling so I feel better.
