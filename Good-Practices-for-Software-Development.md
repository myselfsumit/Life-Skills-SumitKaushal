# Review Questions

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?
- The use of the **Boosted app for time tracking** was new to me.  
- Also, the practice of **joining meetings 5â€“10 minutes early** to build rapport with the team was a fresh perspective.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on?  
**Answer:**  
I need to improve my ability to **over-communicate effectively**. Sometimes I assume others already know what I am working on, but in reality, timely updates can prevent confusion.  

**Ideas to improve:**  
- Start posting regular updates in team channels.  
- Could you inform the team immediately about blockers or changes in deadlines?  
- Summarize progress at the end of each day for better visibility.
